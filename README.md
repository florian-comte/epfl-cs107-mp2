# Project of the course CS107 at EPFL (mini game)

This is a mini-game project created by two students, Florian COMTE and Nadim SABA, during their first semester at EPFL for the course 'Programmation introduction'.

## How to Launch

To launch the game, run the `Play.java` file in our project.

## Areas

### Main Menu

You choose between three game modes in the main menu:

- Player vs Player: press A
- Player vs AI: press B
- Betting mode (AI vs AI): press C

### Theme Selection

- If you want to play in a classic military theme, press A
- If you like cats and strange unidentified creatures, press B

### Betting Mode, Team Selection

If you chose the betting mode, you will have to bet on either the blue team (A) or the Red team (B).
Note: in the betting mode, initial positions of the units and the starting team are random.

### Pause Screen

- To mute/unmute the background music, press M
- To turn on/off the button sounds, press S
- To quit the game, press N
- To resume the game, press SPACE

## During the Game

During the game, you can move the cursor up, down, right, and left with the corresponding arrow keys on your keyboard.

- Select the unit you want to move by pressing ENTER and move the cursor to the position you want to move the unit to (within its movement radius), then press ENTER again to move it.
- After moving the unit, a window will appear on the top right of your screen listing the different actions that the unit can perform. Follow the instructions on this screen to select the action you want to perform.
- If you choose the action attack, you can change the unit you want to attack with the left and right arrow keys. Once you are ready to attack, press ENTER.
- To switch to the next player's turn, press TAB.
- You can pause the game at any time by pressing SPACE.
- To advance to the next level, press N.
- To reset the game, press R.
- If you chose the military theme, the winning team will perform a celebration dance. If you wish to skip it, press ENTER.

## Extra

- The resources of the project can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vt0aIfKanKeTPRheW2ogcwQkLDqj3BcX/view?usp=sharing). You should put the `res` folder at the root (same level as java).
- If there is a letter on your screen, you can interact with your keyboard (for example in the menu for choosing the theme).
